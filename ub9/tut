    for every lightbulb: e^(-(seenAngle - expectedAngle)^2/standardDeviation^2)
    then multiply everything, get the weight of the particle and normalize all particle weights
    ^ this is written in the task itself smh
    
    
    arccos(np.dot(A,B)) <- angle between vectors
    
    seen angle - as seen by the car
    expected angle - as expected from the particle

    particles weights:
    0.1
    0.02
    0.2
    resulting ranges:
    0-0.1
    0.1-0.12
    0.12-0.32
    
    in an array of 100 particles, so we have an array with cell size of 1/100=0.01
    particle #2 would probably be lost like this (?) because we only put particles 
    at the center of each cell into it
    in cell #0 would be the particle at position 0.005, which would be the first one in this example
    
    atan2(sum(sin()),sum(cos())) <- build the average of the particle angles
